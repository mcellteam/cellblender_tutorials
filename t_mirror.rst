   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Ctrl-M`


The mirror tool mirrors a selection across a selected axis.

The mirror tool in *Edit Mode* is similar to
Mirroring in Object Mode.
It is exactly equivalent to scaling by -1 vertices,
edges or faces around one chosen pivot point and in the direction of one chosen axis, only it is faster/handier.


After this tool becomes active, select an axis to mirror the selection
on entering :kbd:`X`, :kbd:`Y`, or :kbd:`Z`.

You can also interactively mirror the geometry by holding the :kbd:`MMB` and dragging in
the direction of the desired mirror direction.


Axis of Symmetry
================

For each transformation orientation,
you can choose one of its axes along which the mirroring will occur.

As you can see, the possibilities are infinite and the freedom complete:
you can position the pivot point at any location around which we want the mirroring to occur,
choose one transformation orientation and then one axis on it.


Pivot Point
===========

Pivot points must be set first.
Pivot points will become the center of symmetry.
If the widget is turned on it will always show where the pivot point is.

In Fig. :ref:`fig-mesh-deform-mirror-center` the pivot point default to
median point of the selection of vertices in *Edit Mode*.
This is a special case of the *Edit Mode* as explained on the
pivot point page.

          Mesh after mirrored along X axis.


In Fig. :ref:`fig-mesh-deform-mirror-cursor` the pivot point is the *3D Cursor*,
the transformation orientation is *Local*, a.k.a. the Object space,
and the axis of transformation is X.

          Mesh after mirrored along X axis using the 3D cursor as a pivot point.


Transformation Orientations
===========================

Transformation Orientations
are found on the 3D View header, next to the *Widget* buttons.
They decide which coordinate system will rule the mirroring.


Mirror Vertex Group
===================

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Mesh --> Mirror --> Mirror Vertex Group`

This tool works only with a perfectly symmetrical mesh (along the local X axis).
Those vertices that have no corresponding vertex on the other side will not be affected.

Mirror Weights
   With this option checked, every selected vertex receives
   the group/weight information of its symmetrical counterpart.
   If both vertices are selected, it will be a group/weight information exchange;
   if only one is selected, information from the unselected will be copied into the selected one,
   that loses its own information. Information on group/weight is passed for the active group only,
   unless *All Groups* is checked, in which case it is passed for all groups.
Flip Groups Names
   Works with selected vertices that belong to vertex groups with "symmetrical names"
   (with components like "L", "R", "right", "left").
   All selected vertices that belong to the active group, or to the symmetrical of the active group,
   will have their assignation to that group replaced by an assignation to the symmetrical one;
   however, its weight will be preserved.
All Groups
   If *All Groups* is checked, all assignations to these kind of groups
   will be replaced by the symmetrical counterpart, also keeping the old weights.
   
Usually only one of those operations (*Mirror Weights*, *Flip Groups Names*)
will be performed, though you can tick both at the same time,
if you know what you are doing (these 2 operations could even cancel each other).
